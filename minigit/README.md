"June 27-commit class properly structured to support a merkle tree and blob class also implemented"
"commits cannot handle large directories of change, currently still don't know how to add trees(directories to be changed) onto the existing repo tree"

"June 28- as of now, init, add, and commit are most implemented"
"some functionality is reduced-for example, the deletion of multiple files when added to the staging area"
"checkout,log, and rm are still heavily scuffed"
