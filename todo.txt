go through Repository.java and delete stuff inside methods
probably clear most of Commit, let them figure out how to implement stuff

then we should try and reimplement all of the things we removed ourselves and
make sure we still can pass test cases --Ahmed
anything that was far too difficult to reimplement, maybe we provide more
structure


Ask Marina about grading and tests!!
Main, utils, gitletTests untouched

- need to figure out how to read terminal input before exception is thrown

will they be able to setup everything on their computers? Junit 5.8 does not
work. only Junit 4. Possibly might need to use an older SDK as well, not sure
